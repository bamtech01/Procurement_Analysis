### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial data preparation phase, we perform the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring procurement data to answer key questions such as:
